<h2>Getting Started<h2/>

<h3> Installing php [WINDOWS]</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Download your appropriate version of PHP from the following site: 
<a href="https://www.php.net/downloads.php">https://www.php.net/downloads.php</a> (I choose X64 Thread Safe)
</li>
<li>
Once downloaded extract the zip file in a safe location `C:\php`
</li>
<li>Now you'll need to add the path of this folder to your PATH environment variable in windows</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running the web server</h3>
<ul>
<li>Opening a terminal in the path to this project on your pc type the command: `php -S localhost:4000`</li>
<li>The command should spin up the web server and allow you to access the website in `localhost:4000` in your browser</li>
</ul>
